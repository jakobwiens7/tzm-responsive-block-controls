## Hooks and Filters

### How do I define custom breakpoints?

Add the following to your `functions.php` file:

```php
function override_responsive_block_controls_breakpoints( $breakpoints ) {
	$breakpoints['phone'] = '781px';
	$breakpoints['tablet'] = '1024px';
	$breakpoints['laptop'] = '1366px';
	return $breakpoints;
}
add_filter('tzm_responsive_block_controls_breakpoints', 'override_responsive_block_controls_breakpoints');
```

### How do I disable the default CSS?

Disable the plugin's CSS output with:

```php
function enqueue_responsive_block_controls_css( $bool ) {
	return  false;
}
add_filter('tzm_responsive_block_controls_output_css', 'enqueue_responsive_block_controls_css');
```
